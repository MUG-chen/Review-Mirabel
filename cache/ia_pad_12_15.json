    "summary": "The study compares the antimutagenic activity of white tea and green tea using the Salmonella assay, highlighting white tea's superior effectiveness, particularly Exotica China white tea, against various heterocyclic amine mutagens. The research suggests that the higher potency of white tea may be due to the synergistic effects of its major and minor constituents, including high levels of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Mechanism studies indicate that white tea inhibits certain enzyme activities and mutagenic processes, contributing to its antimutagenic properties.",
