    "summary": "The Lifestyle Heart Trial investigated whether comprehensive lifestyle changes could reverse coronary heart disease. In this study, 28 patients followed a low-fat vegetarian diet, stopped smoking, managed stress, and engaged in moderate exercise, resulting in regression of coronary artery lesions after one year. The trial demonstrated that lifestyle modifications might lead to regression of coronary atherosclerosis without lipid-lowering drugs.",
    "questions": [
      "Did 82% of experimental-group patients have an average change towards regression?",
      "Were comprehensive lifestyle changes suggested to bring about regression of coronary atherosclerosis?",
      "Was the Lifestyle Heart Trial a prospective, randomised, controlled trial?",
      "Did the average percentage diameter stenosis of lesions greater than 50% regress in the experimental group?",
      "Was the trial conducted to determine the effects of lifestyle changes on coronary atherosclerosis?",
      "Did the average percentage diameter stenosis of lesions greater than 50% progress in the control group?",
      "Did the study conclude that lifestyle changes might reverse severe coronary atherosclerosis?",
      "Did the study analyze 195 coronary artery lesions?",
      "Did the average percentage diameter stenosis of lesions greater than 50% in the experimental group change to 55.8%?",
      "Did the study suggest lifestyle changes could reverse coronary atherosclerosis?",
      "Was the average percentage diameter stenosis in the experimental group lower after one year?",
      "Did the study conclude that lifestyle changes could lead to regression of coronary heart disease?",
      "Did the average percentage diameter stenosis regress in the experimental group?",
      "Was a low-fat vegetarian diet part of the lifestyle changes in the experimental group?",
      "Did the average percentage diameter stenosis of lesions greater than 50% in the control group change to 64.4%?",
      "Were 20 patients assigned to the usual-care control group?",
      "Was the study conducted to assess the impact of lifestyle changes on heart disease?",
      "Were the lifestyle changes aimed at reversing coronary heart disease?",
      "Did the average percentage diameter stenosis progress in the control group?",
      "Was the regression of coronary artery lesions observed in the experimental group?",
      "Was stress management training included in the lifestyle changes for the experimental group?",
      "Did the average percentage diameter stenosis in the control group change to 46.1%?",
      "Did the study find that lifestyle changes could lead to regression without medication?",
      "Was the initial average percentage diameter stenosis of lesions greater than 50% in the experimental group 61.1%?",
      "Did the experimental group experience regression of coronary artery lesions?",
      "Did the study measure changes in coronary artery lesions over a period of one year?",
      "Was quantitative coronary angiography used to analyze the lesions?",
      "Was the study conducted without the use of lipid-lowering drugs?",
      "Was the initial average percentage diameter stenosis in the experimental group 40.0%?",
