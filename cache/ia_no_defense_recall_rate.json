    "summary": "The study investigated the effects of an uncooked vegan diet rich in lactobacilli on patients with rheumatoid arthritis, comparing an intervention group with a control group. While subjective relief of symptoms was reported by the intervention group, objective measures of disease activity showed no significant statistical difference between the groups. However, a composite index indicated some improvement in disease activity measures, and stepwise regression analysis linked dietary changes to decreased disease activity.",
    "questions": [
      "Did the study conclude that an uncooked vegan diet decreased subjective symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?",
      "Did the stepwise regression analysis associate a decrease in disease activity with lactobacilli-rich drinks?",
      "Did half of the patients experience adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhoea?",
      "Did the study suggest that large amounts of living lactobacilli might have positive effects on objective measures of rheumatoid arthritis?",
      "Did a composite index show a higher number of patients with improved disease activity measures in the intervention group?",
      "Was the study focused on the effects of an uncooked vegan diet on rheumatoid arthritis?",
      "Did the study report that a return to an omnivorous diet aggravated symptoms?",
      "Was there no need for gold, methotrexate, or steroid medication in the intervention group according to the regression analysis?",
      "Did the study find that the intervention group experienced subjective relief during the intervention?",
      "Did a return to an omnivorous diet aggravate symptoms in the study participants?",
      "Did the intervention group consume a diet rich in lactobacilli?",
      "Did the study find a positive subjective effect that was not discernible in objective measures?",
      "Did some patients stop the experiment prematurely due to adverse effects?",
      "Did the intervention group report subjective relief of rheumatic symptoms?",
      "Was the study's intervention group on a diet rich in lactobacilli?",
      "Was chlorophyll-rich drink consumption linked to decreased disease activity?",
      "Were there statistically significant differences in rheumatic disease activity indicators between the diet and control groups?",
      "Was the study conducted with patients randomized into diet and control groups?",
      "Did the study find that subjective relief was reported by the intervention group?",
      "Was the duration of morning stiffness used as an objective measure in the study?",
      "Did the study involve testing the effects of a diet on rheumatoid arthritis patients?",
      "Was the p-value for the regression analysis 0.02?",
      "Was the study's intervention diet rich in lactobacilli?",
